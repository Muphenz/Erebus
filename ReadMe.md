### Webpage Interface üåê

This theme exclusively modifies the appearance of the Firefox browser interface and does not alter the display of webpages. For a fully immersed dark mode experience, consider using it in conjunction with the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/">Dark Reader</a> add-on.

### Visuals üñº

Firefox doesn't support a gallery for themes, in contrast to add-ons. Therefore, all photos will be hosted on GitHub.

#### Home Page

### Minimalism üèÅ

To achieve a minimalist layout, the home page is intended to be kept bare and unadorned. Usually, you'll find the settings icon located on the home page. Yet, the settings icon won't be visible on the home page for this particular theme. Since the browser settings is conveniently accessible in the application menu (depicted by the triple lines icon ‚ò∞), the settings icon on the home page was hidden to maintain a minimalistic design. The settings icon is still present. You'll spot the icon if you hover your mouse over it. However, the color was changed to blend in with the background to create the illusion that the icon was removed.

![Settings Icon](https://github.com/Muphenz/Erebus/assets/154757113/7e9fa69c-b849-4747-89af-6f910d0fee25)

When home content is enabled for the home page, certain text elements may become obscure or invisible. This occurs because Firefox allows altering the settings icon color on the home page only when the text color on the home page is also adjusted. Consequently, it's strongly advised to eliminate all content from the home page to achieve the minimalist aesthetic intended by this theme.

#### Steps

I. Navigate to the application menu and proceed to the browser settings.

II. Select the home tab.

III. Scroll down to the bottom of the page. Choose Firefox home for both the home page and new tab in the drop-down menu. Then proceed to deselect web search, shortcuts, recommendations by Pocket, and recent activity.

Upon successfully executing all steps, your home page will boast a <a href="https://github.com/Muphenz/Erebus#home-page">sleek and minimalist design</a>.

### Notifications üö®

The default Firefox dark mode theme displays a blue arrow notification upon completion of a download. In this theme, deliberate adjustments were made to change the notification color to white, aligning it with other icons. This frees users from the obligation to clear notifications every time a download occurs. Rest assured, you will still receive a notification indicated by a check mark for a brief download or a loading circle followed by a check mark after an extended download time, signaling the completion of your download.

![Download Notification](https://github.com/Muphenz/Erebus/assets/154757113/2403f2b9-2092-4146-b5ae-f1c917be161e)

Firefox themes are unable to customize the color of the Firefox version update notification icon to integrate with this theme. This can only be achieved by injecting custom styling rules. As a result, the icon will remain in its original green color.

### Launch üöÄ

When using customized themes, whether it's the Erebus theme or another one, you may notice a delay in the theme rendering when launching Firefox. During this time, the default Firefox theme briefly appears for the first 1 or 2 seconds before the customized theme finishes loading. To fix this issue, you can disable the skeleton UI to ensure that the theme renders immediately upon launching Firefox.

#### Steps

I. Type about:config in the search bar to access advanced preferences. If you receive a notification warning about potential risks, proceed past it.

![About-Configuration](https://github.com/Muphenz/Erebus/assets/154757113/dd04e5e1-2a59-49d3-bc2c-b80924b513b7)

II. Search for browser.startup.preXulSkeletonUI and update it to false.

![Browser Start Up](https://github.com/Muphenz/Erebus/assets/154757113/eb102533-690b-4e47-aca7-d6e2446374e6)

This solution only applies if the theme is downloaded directly from the Firefox add-on store. If the theme utilizes the Firefox Color add-on, this method may not resolve the rendering delay.

### Trivia üìó

According to Greek mythology, Erebus represents the primordial deity of darkness that predates the birth of the gods.
